### Hi there 👋

I'm a software dev in healthcare, passionate about improving the patient journey through technology (someone's got to do it, right?) The marginal cost of software can be zero. 

I'm a curious person at heart, have taken apart most things I own and love looking into new production bugs. 

I'm training to be a volunteer firefighter, keen on being a useful body when needed, it's only a matter of time. It's also my AGI backup plan, I figure a human body is a lot easier to fuel in a remote location over an electric robot. Unless they go nuclear? Given the current state of self driving cars, we have time. I'm keen on using software to assist with firefighting though first I must learn the everyday challenges.
