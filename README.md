### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software dev in healthcare, passionate about improving the patient journey through technology (someone's got to do it, right?) The marginal cost of software can be zero. 

I'm a curious person at heart, have taken apart most things I own and love looking into new production bugs. 

I'm training to be a voulenteer firefighter, keen on being a useful body when needed, it's only a matter of time. It's also my AGI backup plan, I figure a human body is a lot easier to fuel in a remote location over an electric robot. Unless they go nuclear? I'm keen on using software to assist with firefighting, first I must learn fire.
